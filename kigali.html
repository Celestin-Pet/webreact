                        <p class="card-text" >Ideally positioned in the centre of Rwanda, Kigali extends across several hills and valleys, with good road links to the rest of the country. The verdant capital city is pleasantly low key yet dynamic and progressive, with just over one million inhabitants. First-time visitors to the bustling and colourful centre often remark how clean the streets are, a matter of pride across every community throughout the country. <br>
                            Kigali is a relatively new city. It was founded as an administrative outpost in 1907, and became the capital of the country at independence in 1962, shifting focus away from Huye.</br>
