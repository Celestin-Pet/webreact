                        <p class="card-text" >Golden monkeys are known to have unique characters and are a rare species that are endangered at the moment and they are currently found in Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda. They are easily recognized due to the yellow patches that can be seen all over their bodies. The golden monkeys are also known as &#39the old world monkey&#39 and the only way to separate these primates from others is by their noses. The golden monkeys in the Rwanda are divided into two troops and the largest is located in the Sabyinyo and this has 80 to 100 monkeys and it is the most visited troop in Rwanda.

                        <h4 class="card-title"><strong>Golden monkey trekking-Culture experience at Gorilla Guardians Village-Back to Kigali </strong> </h4>
                        <p class="card-text">Early morning at 4h00 am, our driver-guide will pick you up from your hotel, short briefing about your golden monkey trekking tour and drive to Volcanoes National Park, the drive last approximately 2h30. On arrival at park headquarters, proceed with registration and briefing. Tea and coffee will be given before starting the adventure into the forest. Local porters can be arranged and help with the guide to complete the gorilla trekking experience.<br>You&#39;ll be briefed by the park rangers and then escorted into the misty jungles to find your nemesis. These fragile cute little golden monkeys light up the jungle and alter all your perceptions about the wild creatures that occupy jungles across the world. It&#39;s a moment you want to keep forever, so make sure you&#39;re ready to be rewarded for your courage to come to Africa. </br></p>
                        <p class="card-text">The search for these golden creatures takes between 1 to 3 hours, you&#39;ll spend one hour observing their peculiar habits, including feeding, grooming, socializing, and family squabbles. The sight of these incredible creatures is the climax of this entire safari. 
                            Return to the base and transfer to Gorilla Guardians Village in Kinigi for Rwanda culture and heritage experience. Gorilla Guardians Village is a place where former mountain gorilla poachers have turned into conservationist. 
                            While most of the focus of Volcanoes National Park falls squarely onto the animals, this cultural village puts the spotlight back onto the people. Visitors get to experience Rwandan village life by grinding seeds, firing bows and arrows, taking part in a traditional intore dance and even partaking in the marriage of a king to his queen.
                            After this amazing experience, you will have lunch at Musanze town and transfer back to Kigali, straight to your hotel or to Kigali International Airport for your departure flight.
